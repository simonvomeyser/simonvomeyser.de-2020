My personal freelancer website
</h1>

This side project took a while, but I finally managed to launch a `1.0` version. I wanted to have a place to showcase things I worked on.

## About this Project:

- Build with React and Gatsby (ðŸ’˜)
- Used [React Intl](https://github.com/formatjs/react-intl/) for the two language setup
- Animations done with awesome [React Pose](https://popmotion.io/pose/) now [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) 
- Hosted by the almighty [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
- Recently moved the domain to [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) for asset caching and other reasons I don't understand yet
- API uses a small [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) installation, had to smuggle PHP into the stack 
- Tried my best doing the design myself ðŸ’©

Doing your website as a web developer is quite scary, please don't say *that's all you could do* or laugh at some components still using classes. These components have feelings too.

Feel free to dig into the history of me trying my best to finish this project between client work.

I promise I tried to keep the profanities in commits to a minimum...
