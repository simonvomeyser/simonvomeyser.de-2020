My humble blog about the different things I learn on this intimidating journey through web development land. I write about technical stuff but sprinkle in a few words about project management from time to time, all decorated with some very nerdy humor.

I developed the platform myself by using a Laravel installation, the posts are stored as markdown files and version controlled. I needed to do quite a few customizations with the Markdown parser, so I wrote <a href="https://simple-web.dev/extending-laravel-markdown-with-lazy-images" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a post</a> about that.
