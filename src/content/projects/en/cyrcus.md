My first larger Wordpress project, done the metal band Cyrcus. It's possible to understand the lyrics from time to time, I promise!

The page has a complete webshop and also editable tourdates and news. Another feature was the integration of Facebook images right on the page.

I created the complete frontend and backend, the design was done by my talented colleague <a href="https://simon-koehler.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simon KÃ¶hler</a>
