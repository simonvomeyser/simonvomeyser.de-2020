The very page you are looking at. That's website-ception! I did everything myself here, even the design (forgive me).

Build with React and Gatsby, supporting english and german content, hosted on Netlify. The code is completly <a href="https://github.com/simonvomeyser/simonvomeyser.de" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open source</a> for developers who want to find swear words hidden in commits.
