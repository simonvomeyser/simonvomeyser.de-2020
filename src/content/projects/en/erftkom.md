Frontend and backend implementation of four static pages that should all have a rather similar design, differing only in images, texts and colors.

I found a way to create these pages using only one codebase and a unified build system. The customer is able to change things in one place to update all four pages. All of them use a Laravel API for their contact forms and to integrate the newsletter form with Cleverreach.
