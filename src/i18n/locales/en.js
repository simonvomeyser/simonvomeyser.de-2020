      I am working in web development since <strong>{yearsAsDeveloper} years</strong> and started my journey by doing MySpace pages for metal bands whose lyrics where rather hard to understand. These days I help to make big(er) web projects come to life as a <strong>freelancing Full Stack Developer</strong> and <strong>Team Leader</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      I finished my Master's degree in Media Computer Sciences in 2018 with a nerdy final grade of 1.3. I also taught students there as a tutor.
