      I am working in web development since <strong>{yearsAsDeveloper} years</strong> and started my journey by doing MySpace pages for metal bands whose lyrics where rather hard to understand. These days I help to make big(er) web projects come to life as a <strong>freelancing Full Stack Developer</strong> and <strong>Team Leader</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      I finished my Master's degree in Media Computer Sciences in 2018 with a nerdy final grade of 1.3. I also taught students there as a tutor.

      In my <strong>part time freelancing</strong> I work on projects spanning from car dealer websites to state governments web apps.

      I also work part time as a <strong>senior project manager</strong> at the company <a href="https://www.dekra-media.de" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DEKRA Media GmbH</a>. Over there I am leading a small team of awesome developers and we specialized in E-Learning and learning managemend solutions. We also curse a lot about Internet Explorer in a really agile way.
